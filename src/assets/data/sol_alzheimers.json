Vinpocetine might have a small effect on the decline of thinking skills due to various causes, but most studies have lasted 4 months or less. Most of the studies were published prior to 1990, and results are hard to interpret because they used a variety of terms and criteria for cognitive decline and dementia.","description":"Vinpocetine is a man-made chemical resembling a substance found in the periwinkle plant Vinca minor. People use it as medicine.\n\nVinpocetine production requires considerable laboratory work, stretching the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) definition of a dietary supplement. Vinpocetine is sold by prescription in Germany under the brand name Cavinton. It has also been referred to generically as cavinton. Although website advertising claims that \"more than a hundred\" safety and effectiveness studies have been funded by the Hungarian manufacturer Gedeon Richter, few double-blind controlled clinical studies have been published. Double-blind controlled clinical studies are considered the gold standard for establishing safety and effectiveness.\n\nBecause some people think vinpocetine might improve blood flow to the brain, it is used for enhancing memory and preventing Alzheimer’s disease and other conditions that harm learning, memory, and information processing skills as people age.\n\nVinpocetine is also used for preventing and reducing the chance of disability and death from ischemic stroke. This is the type of stroke that occurs when a blood clot stops blood flow in the brain, causing brain cells (neurons) to die because they are not receiving oxygen. People try vinpocetine for preventing and treating stroke right after it happens because they think vinpocetine might help keep blood from clotting and might also protect neurons against the harmful effects of oxygen deprivation.\n\nOther uses for vinpocetine include treating symptoms of menopause, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), and seizure disorders; and preventing motion sickness.\n\nHealthcare providers sometimes give vinpocetine intravenously (by IV) for treating seizure disorders and stroke.","link":"","linkType":"category","linkValue":"","image":"img_default/1_alzheimer.png","publishedDate":"\/Date(1479448272003)\/","rank":100,"beginDate":"\/Date(1479448272003)\/","endDate":"\/Date(1479448272003)\/","totalRows":0,"warnings":"Vinpocetine can cause some side effects including stomach pain, nausea, sleep disturbances, headache, dizziness, nervousness, and flushing of the face. Vinpocetine might weaken the immune system in some people. This might reduce the body’s ability to fight infections. If you already have a weakened immune system due to other conditions such as HIV/AIDS or cancer treatment, check with your healthcare provider before using vinpocetine.\nMedications that slow blood clotting (Anticoagulant / Antiplatelet drugs) interacts with VINPOCETINE\nVinpocetine might slow blood clotting. Taking vinpocetine along with medications that also slow clotting might increase the chances of bruising and bleeding.\n\nSome medications that slow blood clotting include aspirin, clopidogrel (Plavix), diclofenac (Voltaren, Cataflam, others), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others), naproxen (Anaprox, Naprosyn, others), dalteparin (Fragmin), enoxaparin (Lovenox), heparin, warfarin (Coumadin), and others.\n\nWarfarin (Coumadin) interacts with VINPOCETINE\nWarfarin (Coumadin) is used to slow blood clotting. Vinpocetine might increase how long warfarin (Coumadin) is in the body, and increase the chances of bruising and bleeding. Be sure to have your blood checked regularly. The dose of your warfarin (Coumadin) might need to be changed.","sideeffects":"Vinpocetine can cause some side effects including stomach pain, nausea, sleep disturbances, headache, dizziness, nervousness, and flushing of the face.","dosage":"10mg 1x day","anticoagulant":true,"carcinogenic":false,"hypoglycemic":false,"liverdamage":false,"kidneydamage":false,"city":"","state":"","postalCode":"","country":"","areaCode":"","closed":false,"carousel":false,"carousel_caption":"","showvideo":false,"moviecategory":"SciFi","duration":"00:00:00"},{"bodyLinks":"","FeedId":"5e9b64ba-890c-4cf4-9551-edf5f82cd86e","category":"sol_alzheimers","title":"NAD+","author":"","shortDescription":"NADH stands for \"nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) + hydrogen (H).\" NADH improves mental clarity, alertness, concentration, and memory; as well as for treating Alzheimer’s.

The team then performed brain scans on the participants to measure the levels of a naturally occurring antioxidant, called glutathione, floating through their noggins. It turned out, the subjects who had reported drinking the most milk had higher levels of glutathione -- and possibly a lower risk of Alzheimer\u0027s disease.\nGlutathione (L-gamma-glutamyl-L-cysteinyl-glycine) is a molecule synthesized in the body from the three amino acids L-glutamic acid, L-cysteine and glycine.\nThe Alzheimers glutathione connection holds promise for a treatment that could truly help. Glutathione (gamma-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine; GSH) is the most abundant low-molecular-weight thiol, and GSH/glutathione disulfide is the major redox couple in animal cells. Glutathione deficiency contributes to oxidative stress, which plays a key role in aging and the pathogenesis of many diseases (including kwashiorkor, seizure, Alzheimer\u0027s disease, Parkinson\u0027s disease, liver disease, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, HIV, AIDS, cancer, heart attack, stroke, and diabetes). New knowledge of the nutritional regulation of GSH metabolism is critical for the development of effective strategies to improve health and to treat these diseases especially Alzheimers as recent studies have shown. \nWARNING: Glutathione Supplements:Don\u0027t Work and May Be Harmful. Once a tumor has been established, elevated levels of glutathione may act to protect cancerous cells by conferring resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. If glutathione is so fantastically important, it makes sense that we should be able to incorporate a bit extra with asimple supplement and wallah! feel instantly revitalized. The problem with this desirably convenient solution however, is that oral glutathione supplements have repeatedly performed poorly in studies testing their absorption. Although some practitioners have reported a success with intravenous glutathione formulations, this method is invasive, expensive and often inaccessible to the average individual. Another concern with glutathione supplementation is that by introducing large quantities of artificial glutathione, the body’s natural system for production will be disrupted. When a surge of compounds is introduced via synthetic supplementation, the body may cease its own production under the false perception that there are already adequate stores available. Over time, this mis-signaling could lead to a dependency on supplements as natural production screeches to a halt. What are the risks of taking glutathione? Taking glutathione long-term has been linked to lower zinc levels. Inhaled glutathione may also trigger asthma attacks in people who have asthma. Symptoms may include wheezing. Avoid taking glutathione if you\u0027re sensitive to it. Experts don\u0027t know if taking glutathione is safe during pregnancy and while breastfeeding. Tell your doctor about any supplements you\u0027re taking, even if they\u0027re natural. That way, your doctor can check on any potential side effects or interactions with any medications. Supplements are NOT tested for harmful side effects and are not regulated by the FDA so be careful when taking any supplement. \nTo increase Glutathione levels: A major function of vitamin C is to keep glutathione in its reduced form so that it can continue to provide free radical-quenching effects. Calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3), the active metabolite of vitamin D3, after being synthesized from calcifediol in the kidney, increases glutathione levels in the brain and appears to be a catalyst for glutathione production. It takes about ten days for the body to process vitamin D3 into calcitriol. S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) has also been shown to increase cellular glutathione content in persons suffering from a disease-related glutathione deficiency.","link":"","linkType":"category","linkValue":"","image":"img_default/1_alzheimer.png","publishedDate":"\/Date(1441250109967)\/","rank":60,"beginDate":"\/Date(1441188000000)\/","endDate":"\/Date(1441188000000)\/","totalRows":0,"warnings":"","sideeffects":"","dosage":"","anticoagulant":false,"carcinogenic":false,"hypoglycemic":false,"liverdamage":false,"kidneydamage":false,"city":"","state":"","postalCode":"","country":"","areaCode":"","closed":false,"carousel":true,"carousel_caption":"Milk - Can Drinking Milk Prevent Alzheimer\u0027s Disease?","showvideo":false,"moviecategory":"SciFi","duration":"00:00:00"}]
