In addition, many common supplements like \u003cb\u003eOmega-3 Fish Oils\u003c/b\u003e are \u003cb\u003eanti-coagulants\u003c/b\u003e that can cause bleeding and\u0026nbsp;suppress your immune system.","description":"What are all plants made of? Answer: chemicals. By definition the only thing in all plants are chemicals. All supplements derived from plants, which are the majority, are made of only chemicals. All plants, including our food plants, make harmful chemicals to prevent themselves from being eaten by animals including man. Most supplements are plants extracts and every plant extract can contain hundreds of harmful chemicals in small quantities. Extracts are a CONCENTRATED form of the plant exposing consumers to higher concentrations of harmful chemicals in the plants. The supplements that are plant extracts, which are the majority, contain chemicals that are toxic to both the liver and kidneys. What prevents immediate damage is the fact that these harmful chemicals are in very small quantities but taking multiple supplements over time may have serious consequences. \n\nMany common supplements, like mushroom extracts, can cause significant liver and kidney damage. More commonly used supplements like Omega-3 Fish Oils can be very harmful because they are strong anti-coagulants, i.e., they causes bleeding and decrease the body\u0027s ability to clot. If you take too much Omega-3 Fish Oils or are taking another supplement that is also an anti-coagulant you could easily wind up in the hospital with bleeding. You will notice the lack of any warnings on popular supplements like Fish Oils that it is an anti-coagulant. There are also plenty of perfectly legal, over-the-counter medicines that are damaging to our organs as well.

That means the various pills and powders on the market don’t have to back up any of their health claims and most claims are made for supplements are bogus. Many supplements include ingredients never tested on humans. Some products are labeled incorrectly, failing to disclose certain substances or claiming ingredients that are actually absent. That doesn’t mean every nutritional supplement will damage your health, but it does mean that all of these products have the potential to do real harm.

And you must ONLY BUY Fish Oils in GLASS BOTTLES. \u0026nbsp;DO NOT purchase Omega-3 Fish Oils in plastic bottles. Plastic bottles allow air to seep in and oxidize the Fish oils. Store the glass bottles of Fish oils in the refrigerator. The cold will markedly slow down the oxidation process even if a little air gets in the bottle.

If it is rancid, throw away the whole bottle and file a complaint against the store you purchased it from.

Increased insulin resistance leads to heart disease, which, ironically, is the primary reason for taking a cholesterol-reducing drug in the first place. It promotes belly fat, high blood pressure, heart attacks, chronic fatigue, thyroid disruption, and diseases like Parkinson\u0027s, Alzheimer\u0027s, and cancer. Statins raise your blood sugar. Many people have drug-induced diabetes and NOT genuine type 2 diabetes from taking statin drugs. If you take a statin drug and your blood glucose is elevated it may just be the result of taking the statin drug. Many doctors mistakenly diagnose you with type 2 diabetes. The FDA warns on statin labels that some people have developed memory loss or confusion while taking statins. These side effects reverse once you stop taking the medication. Talk to your doctor if you experience memory loss or confusion. There has also been evidence that statins may help with brain function — in patients with dementia or Alzheimer\u0027s, for example. This is still being studied. Don\u0027t stop taking your statin medication before talking to your doctor.","link":"","linkType":"category","linkValue":"","image":"img_default/1_danger.png","publishedDate":"\/Date(1441498197253)\/","rank":99,"beginDate":"\/Date(1441414800000)\/","endDate":"\/Date(1441414800000)\/","totalRows":0,"warnings":"","sideeffects":"","dosage":"WARNING","anticoagulant":false,"carcinogenic":false,"hypoglycemic":false,"liverdamage":false,"kidneydamage":false,"city":"","state":"","postalCode":"","country":"","areaCode":"","closed":false,"carousel":false,"carousel_caption":"Statin Drugs: A Surprising Cause of Heart Disease \u0026 Diabetes","showvideo":false,"moviecategory":"SciFi","duration":"00:00:00"},{"bodyLinks":"","FeedId":"54d82c5a-2fc5-4f55-9eac-edad63fc5485","category":"sol_danger","title":"Alcohol","author":"","shortDescription":"The researchers noted that even low levels of drinking – just two drinks per day – were allied with an 8 to 23 percent greater risk of developing prostate cancer compared to not drinking at all.","description":"The researchers noted that even low levels of drinking – just two drinks per day – were allied with an 8 to 23 percent greater risk of developing prostate cancer compared to not drinking at all.\u003cbr style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"\u003e\u003cbr style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"\u003e\"This new study contributes to the strengthening evidence that alcohol consumption is a risk factor for prostate cancer.
